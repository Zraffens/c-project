## Introduction

This chat application is a full-featured messaging system designed to enable real-time text communication between multiple users over a Local Area Network (LAN). The system follows a client-server architecture, where:

- A central server program manages all connections and relays messages
- Multiple client programs connect to the server from different computers
- Users can create accounts, log in, and exchange messages with all users or privately
- A command system enables special actions like changing usernames or telling jokes

The application is written in C using the Windows Socket API (Winsock) for network communication and Windows threading for parallel operations. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of network programming, multi-threading, user authentication, and message passing.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several essential files that work together:

- **server.c**: The server application that listens for connections, authenticates clients, and relays messages
- **client.c**: The client application that users run to connect to the server and send/receive messages
- **common.h**: A header file containing shared definitions, constants, and data structures used by both client and server
- **auth.h/auth.c**: Files implementing the authentication system for user registration and login
- **users.txt**: A text file that stores user account information (usernames and passwords)
- **Makefile**: Contains instructions for building the client and server executables

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

To build and run this application, you need:

- A Windows operating system (Windows 7 or newer)
- C compiler (MinGW/GCC or MSVC)
- Basic knowledge of using the command prompt
- All computers must be on the same local network (LAN)

### Building the Application

The project uses a Makefile to simplify the compilation process. To build:

1. Open a command prompt (CMD or PowerShell)
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd path\to\project`
3. Type `mingw32-make all` or simply `make all` if your make utility is in the system path
4. This compiles the source code and produces two executables: `server.exe` and `client.exe`

The compilation process uses GCC with warning flags `-Wall -Wextra` to catch potential issues and links against the Windows Socket library with `-lws2_32`.

### Running the Application

To use the chat system:

1. First, start the server application on one computer:
   ```
   server.exe
   ```
   You can optionally specify a port: `server.exe 9000` (default is 8080)

2. On each client computer, run the client application specifying the server's IP address and port:
   ```
   client.exe 192.168.1.100 8080
   ```
   Replace the IP address with the actual server's IP on your network.

3. Each client will prompt for login or registration
4. After successful authentication, clients can send and receive messages

## Networking Fundamentals

### Understanding Networks

A network is a collection of computers and devices connected together to share resources and information. In our context, a Local Area Network (LAN) is a network confined to a relatively small area, typically a single building or group of buildings like a home, office, or school.

When computers are connected to a network, they need standardized methods to communicate with each other. This is achieved through protocols, which are essentially sets of rules that define how data is formatted, transmitted, received, and processed.

### The Client-Server Model

The client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks between providers of resources or services (servers) and service requesters (clients):

- **Server**: A central computer running specialized software that provides services to other computers on the network. In our chat application, the server:
  - Listens continuously for new connection requests
  - Maintains a list of all connected clients
  - Receives messages from clients and forwards them to their destinations
  - Manages user authentication and account information
  - Processes special commands

- **Client**: A computer or program that requests services from a server. In our chat application, the client:
  - Connects to the server using an IP address and port number
  - Authenticates the user by sending login information
  - Sends user messages to the server
  - Displays messages received from other clients via the server
  - Processes local commands

The client-server model offers several advantages:
- Centralized resource management
- Easier maintenance and updates (just update the server)
- Better security control
- Scalability to handle many clients

### TCP/IP Protocol

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the foundational communication protocol of the Internet and most local networks. It consists of a suite of protocols, but the two most important components are:

- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Responsible for addressing and routing packets of data so they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Every device on a network has a unique IP address (like 192.168.1.100) that serves as its network identity.

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications. TCP establishes a connection between sender and receiver before data transfer begins and ensures that data arrives completely and in order.

TCP is connection-oriented, which means:
1. It establishes a connection before sending data (three-way handshake)
2. It acknowledges received data and retransmits lost data
3. It ensures data arrives in the correct order
4. It properly terminates the connection when communication is complete

Our chat application uses TCP because it needs reliable message delivery. We don't want messages to get lost or arrive out of order.

### Sockets: The Complete Guide

A socket is an endpoint for sending and receiving data across a computer network. It's a software abstraction that represents a network connection at the programming level and serves as the fundamental interface between application software and the networking hardware/software.

#### Socket Types

Sockets come in different flavors based on their properties:

1. **Stream Sockets (SOCK_STREAM)**: These use TCP and provide a reliable, connection-oriented, sequenced data transmission. Our chat application uses stream sockets because we need reliable message delivery.

2. **Datagram Sockets (SOCK_DGRAM)**: These use UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and provide connectionless, unreliable communication. They're faster but don't guarantee delivery or ordering.

3. **Raw Sockets**: These provide direct access to lower-level network protocols, bypassing normal processing. They're typically used for network diagnostics or specialized protocols.

#### Socket Addresses

Each socket has an address consisting of:
- An IP address (like 192.168.1.100) that identifies the computer
- A port number (like 8080) that identifies the specific application/service on that computer

The combination of IP address and port uniquely identifies every network service on the internet.

#### Socket Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: A socket is created using the `socket()` function, which returns a socket descriptor (a numeric identifier).

2. **Binding** (server-only): The server associates its socket with a specific address and port using the `bind()` function. This tells the operating system which network interface and port the server wants to use.

3. **Listening** (server-only): The server calls `listen()` to indicate it's ready to accept incoming connections and specifies a queue length for pending connections.

4. **Accepting** (server-only): The server calls `accept()` to accept incoming connection requests. This creates a new socket specifically for communicating with that client.

5. **Connecting** (client-only): The client calls `connect()` to establish a connection to a server, specifying the server's IP address and port.

6. **Data Transfer**: Both sides can send and receive data using functions like `send()` and `recv()`.

7. **Closing**: When communication is complete, both sides call `closesocket()` to release the socket resources.

#### Socket Programming in Windows

In Windows, socket programming is implemented through the Windows Socket API (Winsock). Before using any socket functions, a Windows program must initialize the Winsock library using `WSAStartup()`, and when finished, clean up using `WSACleanup()`.

#### Socket Example

Here's how our chat application creates and uses sockets:

Server side:
```c
// Create a socket
SOCKET listenSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);

// Bind the socket to an address and port
bind(listenSocket, serverAddr, addrLen);

// Start listening for connections
listen(listenSocket, SOMAXCONN);

// Accept a connection
SOCKET clientSocket = accept(listenSocket, clientAddr, &addrLen);

// Communicate with client
send(clientSocket, message, length, 0);
recv(clientSocket, buffer, bufferSize, 0);

// Close the socket
closesocket(clientSocket);
```

Client side:
```c
// Create a socket
SOCKET connectSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);

// Connect to the server
connect(connectSocket, serverAddr, addrLen);

// Communicate with server
send(connectSocket, message, length, 0);
recv(connectSocket, buffer, bufferSize, 0);

// Close the socket
closesocket(connectSocket);
```

#### Socket Error Handling

Socket operations can fail for various reasons: network issues, resource limitations, permission problems, etc. Each function returns a value indicating success or failure, and when a failure occurs, you can retrieve the specific error code using `WSAGetLastError()`. Proper error handling is crucial for robust socket applications.

#### Socket Blocking and Non-Blocking Modes

By default, socket functions operate in "blocking mode," meaning they don't return until the operation completes. For example, `recv()` waits until data arrives. Sockets can also be set to "non-blocking mode," where functions return immediately with an error if the operation would block.

Our chat application uses blocking mode but handles multiple clients simultaneously through multi-threading.

## Windows Socket API (Winsock)

### Winsock Initialization and Cleanup

The Windows Socket API (Winsock) is Microsoft's implementation of the Berkeley sockets API for Windows. Before using any socket functions, a Windows application must initialize the Winsock library and clean up when finished:

```c
// Initialize Winsock
WSADATA wsaData;
int result = WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 2), &wsaData);
if (result != 0) {
    // Handle error
}

// Use sockets...

// Clean up Winsock
WSACleanup();
```

The `WSAStartup` function:
- Tells Windows which version of Winsock we want to use (2.2 in our case)
- Loads the appropriate DLL into memory
- Fills the `WSADATA` structure with information about the implementation
- Returns zero on success or an error code on failure

The `WSACleanup` function:
- Releases resources used by Winsock
- Should be called once for each successful call to `WSAStartup`

### Socket Creation

To create a socket in Winsock, we use the `socket()` function:

```c
SOCKET sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);
if (sock == INVALID_SOCKET) {
    // Handle error
}
```

The parameters specify:
- `AF_INET`: The address family (IPv4 in this case)
- `SOCK_STREAM`: The socket type (TCP stream socket)
- `IPPROTO_TCP`: The protocol to use (TCP)

The function returns a socket descriptor (a SOCKET handle in Windows) or `INVALID_SOCKET` if an error occurs.

### Connection Establishment

#### Server-Side Connection Handling

For a server to accept connections, it must:

1. **Bind** the socket to a local address and port:
```c
struct sockaddr_in serverAddr;
serverAddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
serverAddr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; // Listen on any network interface
serverAddr.sin_port = htons(port);       // Convert port to network byte order

if (bind(listenSocket, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddr, sizeof(serverAddr)) == SOCKET_ERROR) {
    // Handle error
}
```

2. **Listen** for incoming connections:
```c
if (listen(listenSocket, SOMAXCONN) == SOCKET_ERROR) {
    // Handle error
}
```
The `SOMAXCONN` value specifies the maximum length of the queue of pending connections.

3. **Accept** incoming connections:
```c
struct sockaddr_in clientAddr;
int addrLen = sizeof(clientAddr);
SOCKET clientSocket = accept(listenSocket, (struct sockaddr*)&clientAddr, &addrLen);
if (clientSocket == INVALID_SOCKET) {
    // Handle error
}
```
The `accept` function:
- Blocks until a connection request arrives
- Creates a new socket specifically for this client
- Returns information about the client in the `clientAddr` structure
- Returns the new socket descriptor or `INVALID_SOCKET` on error

#### Client-Side Connection

For a client to connect to a server:

1. **Create** a socket:
```c
SOCKET connectSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);
```

2. **Connect** to the server:
```c
struct sockaddr_in serverAddr;
serverAddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
inet_pton(AF_INET, serverIP, &serverAddr.sin_addr);  // Convert IP string to binary
serverAddr.sin_port = htons(port);                   // Convert port to network byte order

if (connect(connectSocket, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddr, sizeof(serverAddr)) == SOCKET_ERROR) {
    // Handle error
}
```

The `connect` function:
- Attempts to establish a connection to the specified server
- Blocks until the connection is established or an error occurs
- Returns 0 on success or `SOCKET_ERROR` on failure

### Data Transmission

Once a connection is established, both sides can send and receive data:

1. **Sending** data:
```c
const char* message = "Hello, server!";
if (send(socket, message, (int)strlen(message), 0) == SOCKET_ERROR) {
    // Handle error
}
```

The `send` function:
- Sends data over a connected socket
- Returns the number of bytes sent or `SOCKET_ERROR` on failure
- May not send all the requested data at once (though it typically does for small messages)

2. **Receiving** data:
```c
char buffer[1024];
int bytesReceived = recv(socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1, 0);
if (bytesReceived > 0) {
    buffer[bytesReceived] = '\0';  // Null-terminate the string
    // Process received data
} else if (bytesReceived == 0) {
    // Connection closed by peer
} else {
    // Error occurred
}
```

The `recv` function:
- Receives data from a connected socket
- Blocks until data is available or the connection is closed
- Returns the number of bytes received, 0 for connection closed, or `SOCKET_ERROR` on failure

### Error Handling

Winsock functions indicate errors by returning specific values (`SOCKET_ERROR` or `INVALID_SOCKET`). To get detailed error information, use `WSAGetLastError()`:

```c
if (bind(socket, ...) == SOCKET_ERROR) {
    int error = WSAGetLastError();
    // Handle specific error
}
```

Common error codes include:
- `WSAECONNREFUSED`: Connection refused (server not running)
- `WSAETIMEDOUT`: Connection timed out
- `WSAEADDRINUSE`: Address already in use (port already bound)
- `WSAEWOULDBLOCK`: Operation would block (non-blocking sockets only)
- `WSAECONNRESET`: Connection reset by peer
- `WSAEHOSTUNREACH`: No route to host

## Multithreading

### Understanding Threads

A thread is a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently of other code. Multiple threads within a program can run concurrently, allowing different parts of the program to execute simultaneously.

In our chat application:
- The server uses multiple threads to handle multiple client connections simultaneously
- The client uses separate threads for receiving messages and handling user input

Without threads, the server would only be able to handle one client at a time, and the client would have to alternate between checking for incoming messages and reading user input.

### Thread Creation

In Windows, threads are created using the `CreateThread` function:

```c
HANDLE threadHandle = CreateThread(
    NULL,                   // Default security attributes
    0,                      // Default stack size
    threadFunction,         // Thread function
    threadParameter,        // Parameter to thread function
    0,                      // Run immediately
    &threadId               // Thread identifier (optional)
);

if (threadHandle == NULL) {
    // Thread creation failed
}
```

The function returns a handle to the new thread or NULL if creation fails.

The thread function must have this signature:
```c
DWORD WINAPI ThreadFunction(LPVOID lpParam) {
    // Thread code here
    return 0;  // Return value (ignored in our application)
}
```

In our server, we create a new thread for each client connection:

```c
// Create a thread to handle the client
HANDLE threadHandle = CreateThread(NULL, 0, handle_client, (LPVOID)client, 0, NULL);
```

The `handle_client` function receives and processes messages from that specific client.

### Thread Synchronization

When multiple threads access shared data, synchronization is necessary to prevent race conditions and data corruption. A race condition occurs when the behavior of the program depends on the relative timing of events, like two threads modifying the same variable simultaneously.

Our chat application uses a critical section to protect the shared client list:

```c
// Declare a critical section
CRITICAL_SECTION clients_mutex;

// Initialize it before use
InitializeCriticalSection(&clients_mutex);

// Enter the critical section before accessing shared data
EnterCriticalSection(&clients_mutex);
// Access or modify shared data here
LeaveCriticalSection(&clients_mutex);

// Clean up when done
DeleteCriticalSection(&clients_mutex);
```

### Critical Sections

A critical section is a region of code that accesses shared resources and must not be executed by more than one thread at a time. In Windows, the `CRITICAL_SECTION` object provides a simple synchronization mechanism:

- `InitializeCriticalSection`: Prepares a critical section for use
- `EnterCriticalSection`: Waits until the critical section can be entered (blocks if another thread is already inside)
- `LeaveCriticalSection`: Exits the critical section, allowing another thread to enter
- `DeleteCriticalSection`: Releases resources used by the critical section

Critical sections are faster than other synchronization objects but can only be used within a single process.

### Thread Termination

Threads can terminate in several ways:

1. **Normal termination**: The thread function returns
2. **Explicit termination**: Another thread calls `TerminateThread` (dangerous, should be avoided)
3. **Process termination**: When the process ends, all its threads are terminated

In our application, client handler threads terminate naturally when:
- The client disconnects
- A socket error occurs
- The server is shutting down

When a thread terminates, its resources aren't immediately freed. The thread handle remains valid until:
1. The handle is closed using `CloseHandle`
2. The process terminates

Our server closes thread handles immediately after creation since it doesn't need to interact with the threads:

```c
if (threadHandle != NULL) {
    CloseHandle(threadHandle);
}
```

## Data Structures

### Message Structure

The `Message` structure is the core data unit exchanged between clients and server. It encapsulates all the information needed for various types of communication:

```c
typedef struct {
    int type;                  // Message type (auth, chat, command, etc.)
    int command;               // Command type (if applicable)
    char username[32];         // Username
    char target[32];           // Target username for private messages
    char content[BUFFER_SIZE]; // The actual message content
} Message;
```

Each field serves a specific purpose:

- **type**: Identifies the message category
  - `MSG_AUTH` (1): Authentication request
  - `MSG_REGISTER` (2): Registration request
  - `MSG_CHAT` (3): Regular chat message
  - `MSG_COMMAND` (4): Command message
  - `MSG_SYSTEM` (5): System notification
  - `MSG_PRIVATE` (6): Private message

- **command**: For command messages, specifies which command to execute
  - `CMD_HELP` (1): Show help information
  - `CMD_USERNAME` (2): Change username
  - `CMD_PASSWORD` (3): Change password
  - `CMD_DELETE` (4): Delete account
  - ... and more (see common.h for all commands)

- **username**: The sender's username

- **target**: For private messages, the recipient's username

- **content**: The actual message text or command arguments

The `Message` structure is serialized (converted to a byte stream) when sent over the network and deserialized (converted back to a structure) when received. In our application, we send the entire structure as a binary block:

```c
send(socket, (char*)&msg, sizeof(Message), 0);
```

While simple, this approach has limitations:
- It only works if both client and server run on systems with the same data representation
- It doesn't handle endianness differences between platforms
- It doesn't compress large messages or handle partial sends/receives

For a more robust application, you might implement a proper serialization protocol.

### Client Structure

The `Client` structure represents a connected client on the server side:

```c
typedef struct {
    SOCKET socket;         // Network socket
    int id;                // Unique identifier
    char username[32];     // Username
    int authenticated;     // Login status
    char color[10];        // Preferred message color
} Client;
```

Each field tracks important information about the client:

- **socket**: The socket descriptor used for communication with this client
- **id**: A unique identifier assigned by the server (starting from 1)
- **username**: The client's authenticated username
- **authenticated**: Flag indicating whether the client has successfully logged in
- **color**: The client's preferred color for message display

The server maintains an array of pointers to Client structures:

```c
Client *clients[MAX_CLIENTS] = { 0 };
```

This approach allows the server to:
- Keep track of all connected clients
- Send messages to specific clients
- Broadcast messages to all clients
- Find clients by username for private messaging

The critical section `clients_mutex` ensures safe access to this array from multiple threads.

### User Structure

The `User` structure represents a registered user account:

```c
typedef struct {
    char username[MAX_USERNAME_LEN];
    char password[MAX_PASSWORD_LEN];
} User;
```

This structure is used in the authentication system to:
- Parse user information from the users.txt file
- Compare login credentials
- Store new user registrations

The structure is simplistic and doesn't include features you might find in a production system, like:
- Account creation date
- Last login time
- Password hashing
- Email address
- Account status (active/disabled)

## Authentication System

### User Registration

The registration process allows new users to create accounts:

1. The client sends a registration request (type `MSG_REGISTER`) with a username and password
2. The server checks if the username already exists in users.txt
3. If the username is available, the server adds the new user to users.txt
4. The server sends back a success or failure message

The registration is implemented in the `register_user` function:

```c
int register_user(const char* username, const char* password) {
    // Check if user exists
    // If not, add user to file
    // Return result code
}
```

The function returns:
- `AUTH_SUCCESS` (0) if registration succeeds
- `AUTH_USER_EXISTS` (2) if the username is already taken
- `AUTH_FAILED` (1) if an error occurs

### Login Process

The login process authenticates a user:

1. The client sends an authentication request (type `MSG_AUTH`) with a username and password
2. The server checks if the username and password match a record in users.txt
3. If the credentials are valid, the server marks the client as authenticated
4. The server sends back a success or failure message

Authentication is implemented in the `authenticate_user` function:

```c
int authenticate_user(const char* username, const char* password) {
    // Open users file
    // Search for username and password match
    // Return result code
}
```

The function returns:
- `AUTH_SUCCESS` (0) if authentication succeeds
- `AUTH_FAILED` (1) if authentication fails

### Password Management

The current implementation stores passwords in plaintext, which is not secure. In a production system, you would use:

1. **Password Hashing**: Store only the hash of the password, not the password itself
2. **Salt**: Add a random value to each password before hashing
3. **Secure Hash Functions**: Use modern algorithms like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2

Users can change their passwords using the `/password` command, which:
1. Asks for their current password
2. Asks for a new password
3. Updates the users.txt file if the current password is correct

### Account Management

Users can manage their accounts through commands:

- `/username <new_username>`: Change username
  - Verifies the user's password
  - Checks if the new username is available
  - Updates the users.txt file and client data structures

- `/password`: Change password
  - Verifies the current password
  - Updates the users.txt file with the new password

- `/delete`: Delete account
  - Asks for confirmation
  - Verifies the password
  - Removes the user from users.txt
  - Disconnects the client

Each operation creates a temporary file, writes the updated data, then replaces the original file. This approach ensures the users.txt file remains intact even if an operation fails midway.

## Message Processing System

### Message Types

The application uses several message types to handle different kinds of communication:

1. **Authentication Messages** (`MSG_AUTH`):
   - Sent from client to server during login
   - Contains username and password
   - Server responds with a success/failure message

2. **Registration Messages** (`MSG_REGISTER`):
   - Sent from client to server to create a new account
   - Contains username and password
   - Server responds with a success/failure message

3. **Chat Messages** (`MSG_CHAT`):
   - Contain normal user messages
   - Server broadcasts these to all other connected clients
   - Displayed with the sender's username

4. **Command Messages** (`MSG_COMMAND`):
   - Contain special commands prefixed with a slash (/)
   - Processed differently than regular chat messages
   - May trigger special server actions

5. **System Messages** (`MSG_SYSTEM`):
   - Generated by the server to notify clients of events
   - Displayed with a "[SYSTEM]" prefix

6. **Private Messages** (`MSG_PRIVATE`):
   - Sent to specific users rather than broadcast to everyone
   - Initiated with the `/whisper` or `/w` command
   - Include the target username

### Message Flow

The message flow in the system follows different paths depending on the message type:

1. **Client to Server**:
   - Client creates a Message structure and fills the appropriate fields
   - Client sends the message to the server using the `send()` function
   - Server receives the message using `recv()` and processes it based on its type

2. **Server to Client**:
   - Server creates a response or formatting message
   - Server sends the message to the appropriate client(s)
   - Client's receive thread displays the message

3. **Chat Message Flow**:
   - Client sends a chat message to the server
   - Server formats the message with the sender's username
   - Server broadcasts the message to all other clients
   - Each client displays the received message

4. **Command Message Flow**:
   - Client detects a command (starting with /) and processes it
   - If it's a local command (like /clear), client handles it without server interaction
   - For other commands, client sends a command message to the server
   - Server executes the command and sends back appropriate responses

### Message Broadcasting

Broadcasting sends a message to multiple clients simultaneously. The server's `broadcast_message` function handles this:

```c
void broadcast_message(int sender_id, const char* message) {
    EnterCriticalSection(&clients_mutex);
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++) {
        if (clients[i] != NULL && clients[i]->socket != INVALID_SOCKET) {
            // Optionally skip sending back to the sender
            if (clients[i]->id == sender_id)
                continue;
            
            int sendResult = send(clients[i]->socket, message, (int)strlen(message), 0);
            if (sendResult == SOCKET_ERROR) {
                fprintf(stderr, "send failed to client %d: %d\n", clients[i]->id, WSAGetLastError());
            }
        }
    }
    LeaveCriticalSection(&clients_mutex);
}
```

Let's examine this function step by step:

1. **Thread Synchronization**: The function begins by acquiring the `clients_mutex` critical section. This ensures that no other thread modifies the clients array while we're iterating through it.

2. **Client Iteration**: It loops through all possible client slots (from 0 to MAX_CLIENTS-1).

3. **Valid Client Check**: For each slot, it checks if a client exists (`clients[i] != NULL`) and has a valid socket (`clients[i]->socket != INVALID_SOCKET`).

4. **Sender Exclusion**: The function can optionally skip sending the message back to the sender by comparing client IDs with the provided `sender_id`.

5. **Message Sending**: For each eligible client, it sends the message using the `send()` function.

6. **Error Handling**: If `send()` fails (returns SOCKET_ERROR), it prints an error message with the specific error code.

7. **Cleanup**: Finally, it releases the critical section, allowing other threads to access the clients array again.

Broadcasting is an expensive operation that scales linearly with the number of clients. For each message sent, the server must perform N-1 send operations (where N is the total number of clients). This approach works well for a small number of clients but may become a bottleneck in high-traffic scenarios with thousands of clients.

### Private Messaging

Private messaging allows one user to send a message that only one specific recipient can see. This is implemented through the `/whisper` or `/w` command.

The process works as follows:

1. The sender enters a command like `/whisper username Hello there!`
2. The client parses this into target (username) and message ("Hello there!")
3. The client sends a CMD_WHISPER command to the server with the target and message
4. The server finds the target user
5. The server formats two messages: one for the recipient and one for the sender (confirmation)
6. The messages are sent to their respective destinations

The server-side implementation:

```c
void send_private_message(Client* sender, Client* receiver, const char* message) {
    char private_msg[BUFFER_SIZE];
    
    // Format for receiver
    snprintf(private_msg, BUFFER_SIZE, "[PM from %s] %s", sender->username, message);
    send(receiver->socket, private_msg, strlen(private_msg), 0);
    
    // Format for sender (confirmation)
    snprintf(private_msg, BUFFER_SIZE, "[PM to %s] %s", receiver->username, message);
    send(sender->socket, private_msg, strlen(private_msg), 0);
}
```

This function formats the private messages with special prefixes—"[PM from username]" for the recipient and "[PM to username]" for the sender—to distinguish them from regular chat messages.

The command handler first finds the target client using their username:

```c
Client* target = find_client_by_username(msg->target);

if (target != NULL) {
    send_private_message(client, target, msg->content);
} else {
    // Target user not found
    send_system_message(client, "User not found");
}
```

This design choice provides several benefits:
- Message privacy: only the intended recipient receives the message
- Confirmation feedback: the sender receives confirmation their message was sent
- Clear visual distinction: private messages are clearly marked with their special prefix

## Command System

The command system provides a way for users to perform special actions beyond simple messaging. Commands are entered as text messages that start with a forward slash (/).

### Command Processing

When a user types a message starting with `/`, the client detects this as a command and processes it differently from regular chat messages:

1. **Client-side Processing**:
   - Extract the command name and arguments
   - For local commands (like `/clear`), handle them directly on the client
   - For server commands, format and send a command message to the server

2. **Server-side Processing**:
   - Receive the command message
   - Execute the appropriate action based on command type
   - Send response(s) to the client(s)

Here's the client-side command parsing function in detail:

```c
int process_command(char* input, Message* msg) {
    char cmd[32];
    char args[BUFFER_SIZE];
    args[0] = '\0'; // Initialize args as empty string
    
    // Extract command and arguments
    if (sscanf(input, "/%s %[^\n]", cmd, args) < 1) {
        strcpy(cmd, "unknown");
    }
    
    msg->type = MSG_COMMAND;
    
    // Process different commands...
    if (strcmp(cmd, "help") == 0) {
        msg->command = CMD_HELP;
        return 1;
    } 
    else if (strcmp(cmd, "username") == 0) {
        // Process username command...
    }
    // More commands...
    else {
        printf("Unknown command. Type /help for a list of commands.\n");
        return 0;
    }
}
```

This function uses `sscanf` to parse the input string. The format string `"/%s %[^\n]"`:
- `/%s` captures the command name after the slash
- `%[^\n]` captures everything else until the end of the line as the arguments

Each command has unique processing logic. Some commands (like `/clear`) are processed entirely client-side, some require user prompts for additional information (like `/password`), and others simply pass their arguments to the server.

### Available Commands

The chat application supports the following commands:

1. **Help Command** (`/help`):
   - Displays a list of all available commands with brief descriptions
   - Implemented server-side and returns a formatted help text

2. **Username Change** (`/username <new_username>`):
   - Allows a user to change their display name
   - Requires password verification
   - Updates both server-side client object and the users.txt file

3. **Password Change** (`/password`):
   - Allows a user to change their login password
   - Prompts for current password and new password
   - Updates the users.txt file

4. **Account Deletion** (`/delete`):
   - Deletes the user's account after confirmation
   - Requires password verification
   - Removes the user from users.txt and disconnects them

5. **Shouting** (`/shout <message>`):
   - Sends a message in ALL CAPS to everyone
   - Server converts the message to uppercase
   - Broadcasts with a special "SHOUTS:" indicator

6. **Private Messaging** (`/whisper <username> <message>` or `/w <username> <message>`):
   - Sends a message to just one specific user
   - Both sender and receiver get confirmation

7. **Color Selection** (`/color <color>`):
   - Changes the color of user's messages
   - Available colors: red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, white
   - Uses ANSI color codes for terminal coloring

8. **Random Number** (`/roll`):
   - Generates a random number between 1 and 100
   - Server broadcasts the result to all users

9. **Online Users** (`/online`):
   - Shows a list of all currently connected users
   - Server compiles the list and sends it back

10. **Clear Screen** (`/clear`):
    - Clears the client's chat window
    - Processed entirely client-side (doesn't send to server)

11. **Random Joke** (`/joke`):
    - Server selects a random joke from a predefined list
    - Broadcasts it to all connected clients with attribution

Each command is identified by a unique command code (CMD_*) defined in common.h. The server's `process_command` function contains a large switch statement that handles each command type appropriately.

## Memory Management

Proper memory management is critical for the stability and security of any application. Our chat application allocates and frees memory in various places, particularly for client structures.

### Memory Allocation

The server primarily allocates memory for new `Client` structures when a new connection is accepted:

```c
Client* client = (Client*)malloc(sizeof(Client));
if (client == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed for client.\n");
    closesocket(client_socket);
    continue;
}
```

The `malloc` function:
- Allocates a block of memory of the specified size (in this case, the size of a `Client` structure)
- Returns a pointer to the allocated memory if successful
- Returns NULL if allocation fails

The code checks for allocation failure and handles it gracefully by closing the socket and continuing (waiting for the next connection).

### Buffer Management

To prevent buffer overflows (writing beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer), the application:

1. Uses fixed-size buffers defined at compile time
2. Uses safe string functions like `snprintf` instead of `sprintf`
3. Ensures null-termination of strings
4. Truncates long messages if necessary

Example from server.c:

```c
char formatted_msg[BUFFER_SIZE + 50];  // Allocate extra space for formatting
snprintf(formatted_msg, sizeof(formatted_msg), "%s: %s", client->username, msg.content);
```

The `snprintf` function:
- Ensures we never write more than the specified size (sizeof(formatted_msg))
- Returns the number of characters that would have been written if there was enough space
- Always null-terminates the output string (unless the size is 0)

### Resource Cleanup

To prevent resource leaks, the application carefully tracks and releases all allocated resources:

1. **Socket Cleanup**:
   - Each socket is closed using `closesocket()` when no longer needed
   - The server closes client sockets when clients disconnect or the server shuts down

2. **Memory Cleanup**:
   - Client structures are freed with `free()` after the client disconnects
   - All allocated memory is freed during shutdown

3. **Thread Cleanup**:
   - Thread handles are closed with `CloseHandle()` after the thread starts
   - Thread resources are automatically cleaned up when they terminate

4. **Winsock Cleanup**:
   - `WSACleanup()` is called before the program exits

5. **Synchronization Cleanup**:
   - Critical sections are deleted using `DeleteCriticalSection()` when no longer needed

Example from server shutdown:

```c
// Cleanup: close all client sockets.
printf("Server shutting down...\n");
EnterCriticalSection(&clients_mutex);
for (int i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++) {
    if (clients[i] != NULL) {
        closesocket(clients[i]->socket);
        free(clients[i]);
        clients[i] = NULL;
    }
}
LeaveCriticalSection(&clients_mutex);

DeleteCriticalSection(&clients_mutex);
closesocket(listen_socket);
WSACleanup();
```

This comprehensive cleanup ensures that resources like memory, sockets, and synchronization primitives are properly released, preventing resource leaks that could impact system stability.

## Security Considerations

### Data Transmission Security

This chat application transfers data without encryption, which means:

1. **No Confidentiality**: Messages can be intercepted and read by anyone with access to the network traffic.

2. **No Integrity Protection**: Messages can potentially be altered during transmission without detection.

3. **No Authentication of the Server**: Clients have no cryptographic way to verify they're connecting to the legitimate server.

In a production environment, these issues would be addressed using:

1. **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: Encrypting the connection between client and server
2. **Message Authentication Codes (MACs)**: Ensuring message integrity
3. **Certificate-based Authentication**: Verifying the server's identity

### Authentication Security

The current authentication system has several security limitations:

1. **Plaintext Password Storage**: Passwords are stored in plaintext in users.txt, making them vulnerable if the file is accessed.

2. **Plaintext Password Transmission**: Passwords are sent unencrypted over the network.

3. **Simple Authentication Logic**: There's nothing to prevent brute force attacks or password guessing.

In a production system, you would implement:

1. **Password Hashing**: Store only the hash of passwords, not the passwords themselves
2. **Salting**: Add a unique random value to each password before hashing
3. **Modern Hash Functions**: Use bcrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2 instead of simple hashes
4. **Rate Limiting**: Restrict the number of login attempts
5. **Account Lockout**: Temporarily lock accounts after failed login attempts
6. **Secure Password Reset**: Implement a secure way to reset forgotten passwords

### Input Validation

The application performs basic input validation in several places:

1. **Username Requirements**: Usernames must be at least 3 characters
2. **Password Requirements**: Passwords must be at least 4 characters
3. **Buffer Size Checks**: Strings are truncated to fit within fixed buffers

However, a more robust application would implement:

1. **More Thorough Validation**: Restrict characters allowed in usernames and passwords
2. **Length Limits**: Maximum lengths for all inputs
3. **Format Verification**: Ensure inputs match expected formats
4. **Sanitization**: Remove or escape potentially dangerous characters
5. **Content Filtering**: Filter inappropriate content from messages

### Other Security Issues

Additional security concerns not addressed in this application:

1. **Denial of Service**: No protections against flooding the server with connections or messages
2. **Resource Exhaustion**: No limits on memory usage or number of connections
3. **IP Blocking**: No ability to ban problematic users by IP address
4. **Secure File Access**: No protection for the users.txt file
5. **Authentication Persistence**: No "remember me" functionality
6. **Session Management**: No proper session tokens or timeout management

## Server Implementation Details

### Client Management

The server maintains a list of connected clients in the global `clients` array:

```c
Client *clients[MAX_CLIENTS] = { 0 };
```

This array is initialized with all NULL pointers, and each slot can either hold a pointer to a `Client` structure or remain NULL (indicating no client in that slot).

Key operations on this array include:

1. **Adding Clients**:
   When a new client connects, the server:
   - Creates a new `Client` structure
   - Searches for an empty slot in the array
   - Assigns the client an ID based on the slot position
   - Stores a pointer to the client in that slot

2. **Finding Clients**:
   Clients can be found by:
   - Array index (for direct access when the index is known)
   - Username lookup (for commands targeting specific users)

3. **Removing Clients**:
   When a client disconnects, the server:
   - Closes the client's socket
   - Frees the `Client` structure's memory
   - Sets the corresponding array slot to NULL

All access to the clients array is protected by the `clients_mutex` critical section to prevent race conditions during concurrent client connections and disconnections.

### Main Server Loop

The server's main loop is responsible for accepting new client connections:

```c
while (server_running) {
    struct sockaddr_in client_addr;
    int addr_len = sizeof(client_addr);
    SOCKET client_socket = accept(listen_socket, (struct sockaddr*)&client_addr, &addr_len);
    
    // Process the new connection...
}
```

The `accept()` function blocks (waits) until a new client tries to connect. When this happens, it:
1. Creates a new socket specifically for communicating with this client
2. Returns information about the client's address
3. Returns the new socket descriptor

The server then:
1. Allocates a new `Client` structure
2. Initializes it with the client socket and assigns an ID
3. Creates a new thread to handle communication with this client
4. Adds the client to the `clients` array

This design allows the server to immediately go back to `accept()` and wait for the next connection, while the newly created thread handles all communication with the just-connected client.

### Client Threads

For each connected client, the server creates a dedicated thread that runs the `handle_client` function:

```c
DWORD WINAPI handle_client(LPVOID lpParam) {
    Client* client = (Client*)lpParam;
    
    // Initialize client state
    client->authenticated = 0;
    strcpy(client->username, "");
    strcpy(client->color, "default");
    
    // Main client communication loop...
    while (server_running) {
        // Receive and process messages from this client
    }
    
    // Cleanup when the client disconnects...
}
```

This thread is responsible for:
1. Initializing the client's state (marking it as unauthenticated)
2. Receiving messages from the client
3. Processing those messages based on their type
4. Handling authentication when the client logs in
5. Broadcasting chat messages to other clients
6. Executing commands from the client
7. Cleaning up when the client disconnects

The thread continues running until:
- The client disconnects (recv() returns 0)
- A receive error occurs (recv() returns SOCKET_ERROR)
- The server is shutting down (server_running becomes FALSE)

Using a separate thread for each client allows the server to handle multiple clients concurrently, without one client's operations blocking others.

## Client Implementation Details

### Connection Management

The client application manages its connection to the server through:

1. **Connection Establishment**:
   - Creating a socket
   - Resolving the server's address
   - Connecting to the server
   - Handling connection errors

2. **Message Sending**:
   - Formatting messages based on type (chat or command)
   - Using send() to transmit messages to the server
   - Checking for send errors

3. **Message Receiving**:
   - Using a dedicated thread for receiving messages
   - Processing received messages from the server
   - Handling disconnections and receive errors

4. **Connection Termination**:
   - Closing the socket when done
   - Cleaning up Winsock resources
   - Ensuring the receive thread terminates

### User Interface

The client provides a simple text-based user interface:

1. **Authentication Interface**:
   - Prompts for login or registration
   - Collects username and password
   - Shows authentication results

2. **Chat Interface**:
   - Displays messages from other users
   - Shows own messages with "You:" prefix
   - Presents system messages and notifications
   - Accepts user input for messages and commands

3. **Command Interface**:
   - Processes commands starting with "/"
   - Provides help information
   - Handles command-specific prompts (like password entry)
   - Shows command results

The interface is implemented using standard console I/O functions (printf, fgets, etc.), making it compatible with any Windows console.

### Receive Thread

The client uses a dedicated thread for receiving messages from the server, implemented in the `receive_handler` function:

```c
DWORD WINAPI receive_handler(LPVOID lpParam) {
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    int recvResult;
    
    while (client_running) {
        ZeroMemory(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);
        recvResult = recv(connect_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE - 1, 0);
        
        if (recvResult > 0) {
            buffer[recvResult] = '\0';
            printf("%s\n", buffer);
        } else if (recvResult == 0) {
            printf("Server closed connection.\n");
            client_running = FALSE;
            break;
        } else {
            // Error handling...
            break;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This thread:
1. Continuously waits for messages from the server
2. Immediately displays received messages
3. Detects when the server closes the connection
4. Handles receive errors

Using a separate thread for receiving messages allows the client to:
- Display incoming messages without the user having to press anything
- Continuously listen for messages while the user is composing their own message
- Detect server disconnections even while waiting for user input

In summary, the client application follows a typical pattern for console-based network clients:
- One thread handles user input and sending messages
- Another thread handles receiving and displaying messages
- Both threads share state through global variables (like client_running)
- The application continues until the user exits or the connection is lost

## Conclusion

This chat application demonstrates fundamental concepts in network programming, multi-threading, and client-server architecture using C and the Winsock API. While not production-ready due to security limitations and basic functionality, it provides a solid foundation for understanding how chat systems work.

The key takeaways from this application include:

1. **Client-Server Model**: Separation of server and client roles with the server acting as the message hub
2. **Socket Programming**: Using TCP sockets for reliable network communication
3. **Multi-threading**: Handling multiple clients simultaneously using threads
4. **Thread Synchronization**: Protecting shared resources from concurrent access
5. **Authentication System**: Basic user registration and login functionality
6. **Command Processing**: Implementing special actions through text commands
7. **Resource Management**: Properly allocating and releasing system resources

These concepts can be expanded to build more sophisticated applications with additional features, better security, and improved user interfaces.
